*****************************************************************
Version 0.0.4
*****************************************************************

For now: 

MCA-NBT-EDIT world <WORLDSAVEDIR> 
Example: MCA-NBT-EDIT world World
extracts all World/region/r.*.*.mca files into World/region/r.*.*/<column#>.gzip.nbt


MCA-NBT-EDIT mcaworld <WORLDSAVEDIR> 
Example: MCA-NBT-EDIT mcaworld World
merges all World/region/r.*.*/<column#>.gzip.nbt files into World/region/r.*.*.mca files


MCA-NBT-EDIT nbt r.*.*.mca
Example: MCA-NBT-EDIT nbt r.0.0.mca
extracts r.0.0.mca files into r.*.*/<column#>.gzip.nbt


MCA-NBT-EDIT mca r.*.*
Example: MCA-NBT-EDIT mca r.0.0
merges r.0.0/<column#>.gzip.nbt files into r.0.0.mca


MCA-NBT-EDIT header r.*.*
Example: MCA-NBT-EDIT header r.0.0
get header dir from r.0.0.mca
(debugging purposes)

*****************************************************************
version 0.0.3
*****************************************************************

FOR TESTING ON MEMORY LEAKS, CHANGE THE ALLOC TO XALLOC, REALLOC TO XREALLOC AND FREE TO XFREE IN NBT.HPP
NOT FOR THE FINAL .EXE

FOR THE MEMORY LEAK (UN)COMMENT IN DEBUG_MEMORY.HPP THE BUG_OFF #define

SO YOU CAN END UP WITH 4 VERSIONS. 

	FOR THE EXTENSIVE LARGE FILES ENDURANCE, WITH MEMORY LEAK
	FOR THE EXTENSIVE TESTING ENDURANCE, WITH MEMORY LEAK

	FOR THE EXTENSIVE LARGE FILES ENDURANCE, WITHOUT MEMORY LEAK
	FOR THE EXTENSIVE TESTING ENDURANCE, WITHOUT MEMORY LEAK
	
	BUT, FOR TESTING REAL LARGE FILES, SWITCH FROM XALLOCOTOR TO NORMAL MALLOC, REALLOC AND FREE....
	
THE DIRECTORY CONAINS 2 FILES WITH BACKUP IN THE NAME. THEY WHERE ALSO USED FOR FINDING THE LEAK, BUT THEY DON'T INTERGRATE BACK INTO THE ORIGINAL MAIN SOURCE.
SO FOR USING THIS OPTION, RENAME (SWAP) THE FILES WITH THE ONES NOW.

GOOD LUCK.

POSSIBILITIES NOW ARE (OR BECAUSE OFF):

		FIXED 2 POINTER CALCULATIONS ON THE APPEND LIST AND/OR COMPOUND TAG
		FIXED MEMORY LEAKS WITH DEBUGING WITH XALLOCATOR (GITHUB)
		ADDED EXTENSIVE TESTING
		CHUNK READER (ALSO GITHUB)
		INTERGRATED THE WHOLE INTO CODEBLOCKS 
		ADDED LOAD FROM MEM (ALL FORMATS)
		ADDED WRITE TO MEM (ALL FORMATS)
		CHANGED OUTPUT TO .TXT FORMAT, TWO OPTIONS. THE ONE WITH THE NUMBERS CAN BE USED TO CREATE DIRECTORIES, CONTAINING THE TREE (COOL MAN!)
		
		
		NOW CONTINOUSLY LOADING TO/FROM DISK/MEMORY IS POSSIBLE. ENDURANCE VERSION OF A WORLD EDITOR IN HIGH SPEED C/C++ (TO BE DONE...)
		CONVERTING/COMBING/EXTRACTING ETC ETC, IS POSSIBLE, ALL ON LONG TERM ENDURANCE RUN.
		
		THIS MEANS A SERVER COULD CREATE WHOLE REGIONS LIKE 5/10 PER SECOND, OR BASED ON VERY EXTENSIVE CALCULATIONS AND LOADING AND SAVING OF REGION FILES.
		ALL C/C++ CODE CAN ADAPT TO THIS.
		
		ANOTHER OPTION IS COMBINING THIS WITH A PROGRAM THAT CAN HOLD A LARGE CANVAS, CONTAINING THE WORLD MAP, FROM  TOP, OR PERSPECTIVE ANGLE, RENDERING, USING	
		FRAGMENT/GEOMETRY/VERTEX HARDWARE GPU SHADERS, FOR RENDERING, RECORDING/ENCODING/DECODING OF VIDEO/ANIMATIONS, EDITING, MANIPULATING, INDEXING, CATALOGING, AUTOMATING
		MINECRAFT LEVELS IN HIGH SPEED.

		YOU CAN USE THE TORTURE LOOP TO TEST ALSO YOUR COMING 'SCRIPTS', LIKE LOADING/ALLOCATING POINTERS, THEIR ADDRESSES, KEEPING THEM, HOW TO DELETE THEM FREE THEM ETC, 
		THEN TEST IT IN THE LOOP, FOR INIT, LOOP, AND AFTER YOU CAN FIX THE CODE. IF YOU ARE WRONG WITH POINTERS, FREEING THEM, USING NEW, DEALLOCTING THE POINTERS WHEN 
		RETURNING FUNCTION ECT., IT WILL SHOW UP. USING THE EXTENSIVE BACKUP FILES CODE, YOU CAN FOLLOW ALL ADDRESSES, BUT THEN THE DATA MUST BE SMALL, AND/OR YOU HAVE TO WRITE 
		ANALYSE ROUTINES. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT... BUT I THINK THE ROUTINE IS A GOOD BASE FOR TESTING FOR MEMORY LEAKS, BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE DATA STORAGE, AND HANDLING.
		IT DOES NOT TEST FOR DATA LEAKS ITSELF, BUT THAT ALSO CAN BE BUILD IN. REAL TIME MEMORY LEAK MONITORING ON REGION EDITING... COOL!
		
		TESTING SHOWS YOU CAN HANDLE LIKE 10 MILLIONS OF CUBES PER SECOND (STORE, DELETE, CHANGE, WITH ALL OPTOINS OF COURSE, LIKE ALL OPTIONS IN MINECRAFT ITSELF....)
		TO HUNDREDS OF CUBES PER SECOND. WHEN USING GPU SHADERS ADAPTED TO THE JOB. THEY RUN IN PARALEL AND VERY FAST, CREATING 3D-PERSPECTIVE DRAWINGS, SO 2D PICTURES, BUT MORE LAYERS 
		AND OR PARTS OF THE CREATED TEXTURE FROM THE GPU SHADERS CAN FORM A 3D CUBE FORM, OR SHAPE DATA WHATEVER. THE MATH THAT CAN BE USED THERE IS SHAMINGLESS. LOOK ON SHADERTOY.COMB
	
		GREETINGS FOR NOW. DONATE TO MY CHILDREN WHEN USING FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES, ACCORDING TO THE COPYRIGHT LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OF THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD AND BYOND THE START. 
		
THE EXTENSIVE TESTS SHOW THE 'BUGS' HAVE BEEN REMOVED TO APPEND LISTS AND COMPOUNDS, AND ALL FORMATS CAN BE CONVERTED BETWEEN MEMORY AND DISK, AND CAN BE CONNECTED TO A NICE INTERFACE MODULE.

AND THERE ARE NO MEMORY LEAKS, NOT ANYMORE.
